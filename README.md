The Odin Project - Project 2: Landing Page


In this project, I will be practicing the HTML, CSS, and Linux/Ubuntu knowledge that I have acquired by building a landing page.

The landing page will be a recreation of the 'desired-outcome.png'. HTML will need to be used for the structure of webpage, and external CSS for the styling.

The final result must match the 'desired-outcome.png' and must utilize all of the the colors and font styles displayed in 'colors-and-font-styles.png'.

I will be strictly utilizing Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the project, create files, and process git commands.


Self Reflection:

Utilization of the Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the project, create files, and process git commands was a breeze, including creating commits and pushing the project to GitHub.

I found myself needing to go back into the HTML to adjust the structure slightly once I began styling with CSS. By completing this project, I've gained more knowledge of how to set the structure up properly with CSS styling in mind.

When it comes to styling, this project serves as a wonderful showcase of my skills utilizing flexbox and its various properties to adjust where elements are positioned on the webpage. All of the styling was completed without needing to look anything up or go back to previous lessons. I believe that the way I am utilizing CSS selectors is organized, however I will make a note to be looking at other's CSS selectors to see if there may be better practices.

There were some aspects of this webpage that may have been out of scope for the project that I invested time into for the purpose of reducing hard-coded values and making everything look nice across a variety of browser sizes or media sizes. As these aspects were mostly outside of the scope of this project, I will be keeping them on my mind as I go forward with learning and plan to return to this project in the future to resolve these areas.
