# odin-landing-page
The Odin Project - Project 2: Landing Page

In this project, I will be practicing the HTML, CSS, and Linux/Ubuntu knowledge that I have acquired by building a landing page.
The landing page will be a recreation of the 'desired-outcome.png'. HTML will need to be used for the structure of webpage, and external CSS for the styling.
The final result must match the 'desired-outcome.png' and must utilize all of the the colors and font styles displayed in 'colors-and-font-styles.png'.
I will be strictly utilizing Linux/Ubuntu's CLI (command line interface) to navigate the project, create files, and process git commands.
